## RULES:
* Each player can roll the dice as many times as they want.
* The number on the dice is accumulated until they get a 1 or they decide to hold the sum.
* If the player holds the sum, it gets added to the score and the turn goes to the next player.
* If they get a 1 the entire sum is dropped and the turn changes.
* The game is won by the player who gets a score of 100 first.
